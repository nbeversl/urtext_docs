Nodes _

A node is region, or set of regions, of a file, up to and including the entire file. A file is itself a node. All nodes can contain other nodes.

The identity of an Urtext node persists no matter its containing filename. This is accomplished by assigning each unique identifier, providing over 46,000 possible nodes per project. See | Node IDs >01q for more information.

Urtext generates IDs automatically on creation of new nodes. ID's can be changed without affecting functionality, though links must then be manually updated as well. 

It is possible to use files containing no IDs in an Urtext project, but then most of the features of Urtext are lost.

{ Node Titles

	By default, the full first non-whitespace line of any node is the node's title. This can be overridden using the `title` metadata key or by following the desired text with the underscore (`_`) character as used in this document. @ue2}
