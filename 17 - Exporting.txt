Exporting _
Urtext can export to plaintext, Markdown and HTML. Output can be written to a file or back into another node in the project. Exporting is dynamic; when changes are made to the source files, exports are immediately updated.

{  Example : Urtext Documentation Exported in Markdown to a File

    This dynamic definition exports the entire documentation from its root node | Urtext  Version: 1.0-alpha  Usage Guide and References >a5m ) in Markdown format to a file called f>./README.md:

    [[ 
        We include four specific root nodes by ID:
        For this documentation, we created a user-defined keyname `flags` to identify nodes that are examples/illustrations. We mark them for exclusion from the Table of Contents with they key `exclude_from_toc`. The following parameters accomplishes this:
        -(flags=exclude_from_export)    

        ID(>l0i)
        HEADER(Metadata Export _)
        MARKDOWN(root=a5m -as_single_file)

     ]]
