Metadata  _

Nodes may contain user-defined metadata in key/value pairs, separated by a double-colon, like this:

  example_key::example value;

Multiple values for a key can be separated using dash with a space on both sides ( - ) :
  
  example_key::another example value - a third example value

A shorthand way to make single-word metadata values (assigned to a predefined metadata key) is to use the hashtag:

  #examplevalue

  { Timestamps _
  
    Timestamps are surrounded on either side by angle brackets (< >) and will parse free-form entries in a variety of formats. Examples:

      <August 1, 2001>
      <Fri., Aug. 20, 2021, 10:20 AM>
      <1066>

    To insert the current date and time anywhere, Ctrl-Shift-T. (Try it in this file)

    Timestamps can be used either as components of key/value metadata as described above or as free-form entries anywhere in text, where they are then called "inline" timestamps.

Metadata entries "remember" their location, allowing them to double as contextual markers or "bookmarks". More information can be found in the Urtext Reference guide.
