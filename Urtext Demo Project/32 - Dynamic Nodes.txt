Dynamic Nodes _ @k8p 

Dynamic nodes aggregate content from other nodes. Among other things, dynamic nodes can query, sort, filter, and format the output of nodes in a variety of ways, making them adaptable to many purposes.

{ Dynamic Node Definitions _
	
	Dynamic node definitions have their own syntax, scope and highlighting and are placed inside double square brackets [[ ]]. These can be inserted anywhere. 

  Ctrl-Shift-]  creates a new dynamic definition in Sublime, auto-populated with a corresponding empty inline node. Try it in anywhere this file. Definitions may also be written manually.	

  Definitions are populated using all-uppercase "directives", with parameters wrapped in parentheses (), much like a function in a programming language. Each directive accepts zero or more parameters to specify and customize the output of the dynamic node.

  The uses for this feature are open-ended and can be extended to the full exent of the power of the Python language by extending a few basic Python classes. A handful of dynamic outputs are included in Urtext (see the Reference Guide). 

  One such output is LIST(). A dynamic definition for a list might look like this:

    [[  ID(>9oj)     Specifies the target ID, show below.
        INCLUDE(*)   Specifies the node(s) to include, in this case all nodes in the project)
        LIMIT(10)    Limits the length of the list 
        SORT(title -alpha)How to sort the included nodes, in this case alphabetically by title.
        LIST()       Indicates what kind of output, in this case a list     
        FORMAT(indent=10) 
    ]]      

  { issue::add indentation; @l8b}

  The output:

  	{ (untitled) >5m7
(untitled) >nad
(untitled) >wyi
(untitled) >5pr
(untitled) >s04
(untitled) >l8b
(untitled) >gfa
(untitled) >zje
(untitled) >00l

  Simple lists like the one above can be extended to trees by passing a number or an asterisk (infinity) into the LIST() directive. For example, the following node shows the list as above, only with a tree of all nodes' descendants:


[[  ID(>l9t)     Specifies the target ID, show below.)
        INCLUDE(*)   Specifies the node(s) to include, in this case all nodes in the project)
        LIMIT(10)    Limits the length of the list 
        SORT(title -alpha)How to sort the included nodes, in this case alphabetically by title.
        LIST(*)       Indicates what kind of output, in this case a list     
    ]]
