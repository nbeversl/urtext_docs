Nodes _

The building block of Urtext is a "node", which is a range, or set of ranges, of a file, up to and including the entire file. This paragraph is in the outermost level of this file. As a node itself, it can be opened by typing its title (signified by the text at the top followed by the underline character) and then pressing return. It is uniquely identified by its ID, @i81, which can appear anywhere in the node.

{
	Bracket Nodes _
	
    Brackets delineate node ranges. This text is in separate node from the paragraph above. A convention of Urtext is to place bracket node IDs right before the closing bracket.

        {   Bracket nodes can be nested arbitrarily deep inside one another. 
	        This is a "child" node of the paragraph  above, which is its "parent."" 

	           { Another level
	                { Another Example Level 
	                    {  Innermost level  @e5n}
                    @5pq}  
	            @80d}

    Add a bracket node by pressing Ctrl-Shift-left-bracket or Ctrl-Shift-1.
    Try it in this file.

{ Bullet Nodes _

    For nodes that can fit on a single line, such as items in a list, short phrases, word definitions, and so on begin the line with the bullet (•); the closing wrapper then becomes the next newline (the end of the same line). Like other nodes:

    • require an ID  @frm
    • can have arbitrary other metadata @xlc
    • become child nodes of their containing node. @hiz

    Add a bullet node, or turn an existing line into one, by pressing Ctrl-Shift-^
    You can try it in this file.

{  Linking Nodes Together _

    Node IDs can be used to links nodes together. A left angle-bracket immediately before a node ID creates a link to that node:

        Here is a link to the node called | Bracket Nodes >xgr 
        Here is a link to the file level node, called | Innermost level >e5n
        Here is a link back to the previous tutorial node, | Welcome to Urtext >a41

    The pipe character (|) before the link auto-populates the title of the linked node if it changes in the future.

    There are several ways to create node links:

    •  Tab Completion _ Type part of the node's title and use tab-completion (tab key) to find the title. @r87
        
        { issue::title completion needs to be re-implemented; @zje}

    • Sublime Command Palette _ (Command-Shift-P), Select "Urtext: Link to ...", then choose the target node from the dropdown. @vlc

    • From Target Node _ : with the cursor in the target node, press Ctrl-Shift-C; This will copy a link to the clipboard. @imr

    • Manually _  Type the right angle bracket (>) followed by a node ID. @x43
