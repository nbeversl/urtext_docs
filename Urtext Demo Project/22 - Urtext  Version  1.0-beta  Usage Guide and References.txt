Urtext Installation, Setup, Demo and Tutorial Project _ @6cd

This is an example project that demonstrates and teaches how to use Urtext. Urtext (pronounced /ˈo͝orˌtekst/) is a syntax and interpreter for writing, connecting and organizing text. You can change and modify anything in this project to experiment with the features described.

This project assumes you are using the Sublime Text implementation of Urtext.

If you have already followed the installation steps, position the cursor on the line with the "Welcome to Urtext" link below and press Ctrl-Shift-/ (Ctrl-Shift-forwardSlash) or hold Ctrl-Shift and click the mouse. If you get lost, pressing Ctrl-Shift-H at any time will return to this "home" node.

=======================================
... Otherwise:

1.  Download Sublime Text. (https://www.sublimetext.com/).

2.  Download Urtext and all its dependencies from the monorepo at `https://github.com/nbeversl/urtext_deps`. You can 
    either download this repository as a .ZIP file and unzip it, or if you want to maintain version control, use `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/nbeversl/urtext_deps`. Put the contents of the cloned/unzipped folder (important: not the folder itself) directly into your `Sublime Text 3/Lib/python3.3` folder. (Note that installing any of these globally will not work; Sublime Text contains its own Python interpreter: https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/api_environments.html#python_version.)

3.  Download the Sublime Urtext package at `https://github.com/nbeversl/urtext_sublime`. Place it in your Packages 
    folder (Sublime Text 3/Packages)

4.  Clone/download this demo project repository and open its folder in Sublime. 

5.  Syntax highlighting is an essential component of Urtext. To set it up:

    Select the Sixteen (for light) or Monokai (for dark) color schemes in Preferences -> Color Scheme ... 

    Change to the Urtext syntax by selecting it in View -> Syntax -> Urtext. To avoid having to do this for every file, select View -> Syntax -> Open All with Current Extension As ... -> Urtext. (This can be undone by repeating the same but selecting Plain Text.)  
    
    { issue::Users may not want to use Urtext theme for all txt. files. Should urtext files have their own extension .urtext? or .rtxt ?; @5m7}

6.  Open this file in Sublime text.

7.  Follow the link on the last line of this file to continue. 

    To follow an Urtext link, position the cursor on its containing line and press Ctrl-Shift-/ (Ctrl-Shift-forwardSlash) or hold Ctrl-Shift and click the mouse.

    If you get lost, pressing Ctrl-Shift-H at any time will return to this "home" node.
