Projects _

An Urtext project is a single folder. The folder must contain at least file with an Urtext Node ID.

To make an new empty project:

	- make a new folder and open the folder in Sublime Text. 
	- Select Urtext : Initialize Project from the Sublime Command Palette. 
	- The folder how has one Urtext file and a `history` folder for tracking edits. (See | History >prp )

{ Using/Adding Existing Files _

	Once a folder contains at least one file with a node ID, you can add and use existing plaintext files in the project without any modification. However for most of the benefits of Urtext you must minimally an ID (|  ?  >01q) in each file.
	
	To do so, select `Urtext : Import Project` from the Sublime Command palette.

    Note the append will occur without a confirmation dialog, so if you are just experimenting with this system, consider making a copy of your file folder so you can revert without having to manually remove the metadata.
