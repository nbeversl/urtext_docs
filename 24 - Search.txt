    Fuzzy and Full Text Search are already implemented in many modern desktop text editors and some mobile text editors. However Urtext has a built-in search and index capability to avoid reliance on editors and environments.
    
	{	Searching

		• Sublime : select `Urtext: Search` from the command pallete. This provides an input panel on the lower edge of the screen. Dynamically search results will be shown in a scratch view as you enter search terms. Press ESC to cancel.  Results include links to source nodes. @k8v

        • Pythonista : Use the "?" Urtext Button. Results will be updated in real time in the view behind the search field. To exit, tap outside the search field. @q8j

	{ 	Search Using Dynamic Nodes

        Search results can populate a dynamic node by using the key-value pair:

            - search:(string)

        For example, the following definition targets node >3x3 (below) and populates it with all nodes containing the word "urtext".
        [[ 
            ID(>3x3)
            HEADER(title::Example Search Results; flags::exclude_from_toc)
            INCLUDE(contents ? urtext)
        ]]

        { title::Example Search Results; flags::exclude_from_toc
def::>uy4; @3x3 }

 
@uy4 }


    
@4p9 }
