Installation and Setup in Sublime Text _

    The Urtext package for Sublime Text utilizes Sublime's embedded Python interpreter both to run the Urtext interpreter/compiler and to add features to Sublime that make working with Urtext easy:

        - binds many Urtext operations to the Sublime command palette
        - adds key bindings (hotkeys) as shortcuts for some features
        - leverages the built-in Sublime browser/palette for Urtext project navigation
        - defines a syntax for use with Sublime's color schemes
        - adds Urtext syntax highlighting to two of Sublime's default color schemes (Monokai and Sixteen)
        - adds filebrowser-like project navigation using | Traverse Modes >a8q

    Some features in this documentation are built into the Urtext interpreter/compiler, while others are part of only the Sublime Text implementation.


{  Dependencies and Installation _

    To use Urtext in Sublime Text:

        - Install Sublime Text: https://www.sublimetext.com/ 

        - The Sublime Urtext package is available on Sublime Package Control: Press ⌘/Ctrl + ⇧ + P to open the command palette. Type Install Package and press Enter. Then search for Urtext. Alternative, clone/download Sublime Urtext ( https://github.com/nbeversl/urtext_sublime ) and place it in your `Packages` folder.

        - Urtext itself and its dependencies are not included in the package. The current recommended setup path is to install dependencies manually into Sublime's Python 3.3 environment following the steps below. There are two options for doing this:

        {  Either Download and Install Dependencies Manually _

                - anytree
                    https://github.com/c0fec0de/anytree
                    The folder needed is "anytree" inside this download; add it to "Sublime Text 4/Lib/python33".
  
                - pytz
                    https://pypi.org/project/pytz/
                    The folder needed is "pytz"; add it to "Sublime Text 4/Lib/python33".

                - six
                    https://pypi.org/project/six/
                    The only FILE needed is "six.py", nothing else; add this directly to "Sublime Text 4/Lib/python33".

                - dateutil
                    https://pypi.org/project/python-dateutil/
                    The folder needed is "pytz"; add it to "Sublime Text 4/Lib/python33".
   
                - diff-match-patch
                    The folder needed is "diff_match_patch"; add it to "Sublime Text 4/Lib/python33".
                    https://pypi.org/project/diff-match-patch/ 
                    
                and:

                 - urtext 
                    https://github.com/nbeversl/urtext
                    This is Urtext itself. Put the entire folder ("urtext") into "Sublime Text 4/Lib/python33".

    {  or Download Dependencies from a Monorepo _

            All of the above depenencies are maintained in recent versions at https://github.com/nbeversl/urtext_deps, with all files in the path locations described above. You can either download this repository as a .ZIP file and unzip it, or if you want to maintain version control, use:
                 
                 `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/nbeversl/urtext_deps`

            Put the contents of the cloned/unzipped folder (important: not the folder itself) directly into your "Sublime Text 3/Lib/python3.3" folder.
