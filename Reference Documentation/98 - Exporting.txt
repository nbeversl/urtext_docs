Exporting _



Urtext can export to plaintext, Markdown and HTML. Output can be written to a file or back into another node in the project. Exporting is dynamic; when changes are made to the source files, exports are immediately updated.



{  Example : Urtext Documentation Exported in Markdown to a File

    This dynamic definition exports the entire documentation from its root node | Table of Contents >a5m ) in Markdown format to a file called f>./README.md:

    [[ 
        We include four specific root nodes by ID:
        For this documentation, we created a user-defined keyname `flags` to identify nodes that are examples/illustrations. We mark them for exclusion from the Table of Contents with they key `exclude_from_toc`. The following parameters accomplishes this:
        -(flags=exclude_from_export)    

        ID(>l0i)
        HEADER(Metadata Export _)
        MARKDOWN(root=a5m -as_single_file)

     ]]

{  Example : Fragment Exported to HTML _

    The following Dynamic Definition is identical to the above, except it exports to HTML.   

`
   [[   +(ID=p23) |  ?  >p23
        +(ID=013) | Introduction >013
        +(ID=z7t) |  ?  >z7t
        +(ID=ac5) | Urtext Reference Tree >ac5
        DEPTH(*)
        SORT(index)
        FORMAT( -preformat)
        EXPORT(f>documentation.html; -html)

    ]]`
