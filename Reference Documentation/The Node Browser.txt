The Node Browser _

The Node browser shows a list of all nodes in the project. 

In Sublime Text use the UI dropdown. 

Press Control-Shift-E or select "Urtext: Node List" from the Sublime command palette (Shift-Super-P). Here you can find a node by typing part of its title.

In the Node List, nodes are sorted by their time of creation, with most recent first. They can also be sorted by index. 
    (see | index >00z)


A Node Browser can be created in plaintext using a dynamic definition such as: 

`[[ ID(>xxx) +(*) ]]`.
