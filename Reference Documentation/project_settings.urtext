project_settings _

Any node with the title "project_settings" provides special metadata keys that affect your project globally. The "project_settings" node is optional. To create one, make a node and title it "project_settings". (The other text content of the node does not matter.) You can have more than one "project_settings" nodes.

always_oneline_meta::False
	When creating a new node, sets whether the metadata will appear on one line separated by semicolon,	or on separate lines.

breadcrumb_key::
	When popping nodes, optionally adds a breadcrumb showing the node from which the popped node was popped, and a timestamp. See | Pulling and Popping Nodes > for more information.

case_sensitive::title - notes - comments
	Specifies which keys' values should be parsed case-sensitively.

console_log::
	(True or False): Sets whether Urtext will log updates, errors, messages to Sublime's Python console.
	(Press Control-tilde(~)  to open the console) Default is False.

contents_strip_internal_whitespace::
	When including contents in dynamic nodes, determines whether internal multiline whitespace gets stripped from the dynamic output. Default is True.

contents_strip_outer_whitespace::
	When including contents in dynamic nodes, determines whether leading or trailing whitespace gets stripped from the dynamic output. Default is True

exclude_files::
	Sets filenames in the project folder(s) to be excluded from the project, if any.

exclude_from_star::title - _newest_timestamp - _oldest_timestamp - _breadcrumb - def
	When marking metadata using the * and ** syntax, these keys will get omitted, if present. For more information see | Propagating metadata to descendents >

extensions::/Users/nathanielbeversluis/Documents/Urtext All Aspects/extensions_active/lint

filename_title_length::100
	Sets a maximum title length (in characters) when using | Reindex Files >

filenames::INDEX - title
	Specifies format for filenames when using | Reindex Files >. Any metadata key used in the project is valid, in addition to the PREFIX placeholder, which will apply a numerical prefix to the outputted filename.

filename_datestamp_format::%m-%d-%Y
	Specifies how dates will be formatted in filenames when using | Reindex Files >

file_index_sort::index - _oldest_timestamp
	When using | Reindex Files > with an index prefix (see above), specifies the order in which the files should be indexed. For more information. 

file_node_timestamp::True

filename_title_length::100
	Sets a maximum title length (in characters) when using Reindex Files

file_index_sort::index - _oldest_timestamp
	When using Reindex Files with an prefix, specifies the order in which the files should be prefixed. For more information see "Reindex Files" in the Urtext Reference.


hash_key::
	The keyname to use for the hash metadata shortcut. See | Hash Key >

home::Urtext Starter Project
	Identifies the home node for the project, connected to the "Home" key
	For example, Press Ctrl-Shift-H to go to the Home node of this documentation, whose ID is 013

new_file_node_format::$cursor
	Specifies the default format for new file nodes. The following values can be string together in any way:
		$timestamp
		$device_keyname
		$cursor - where to position the cursor
		any other Unicode characters are valid â€” arbitrary text, newlines (\r), etc.

new_bracket_node_format::$cursor $timestamp
	As for `new_file_node_format`, only applies to new bracket nodes.

node_browser_sort::index - oldest_timestamp
	Specifies the key order by which nodes will sort in the Node Browser dropdown

node_date_keyname::timestamp
	When creating a new node, if the node gets a timestamp key, this sets the keyname.

numerical_keys::_index - index
	Sets keys that should always be interpreted numerically for sorting and processing in dynamic output.

open_with_system:: 
	File extensions to always open using the default system application. Default included extensions are .pdf

project_title::Starter Project
	Provides a title for the entire project

timestamp_format::%a., %b. %d, %Y, %I:%M %p

	This accepts a Python `strftime` directive. For possible format strings, see https://strftime.org/

timezone::US/Eastern
	Specifices a timezone to which the timestamp keys should be localized, or, if including a timezone in the `timestamp_format`, what timezone to include.


new_file_node_format::$timestamp $cursor
	Spcifies the default format for new file nodes. The following values can be string together in any way:
	$timestamp
	$device_keyname
	$cursor - where to position the cursor

timestamp_format::%a., %b. %d, %Y, %I:%M %p %Z
	Set the format of the timestamp when using Timestamps. This accepts a Python `strftime` directive. For possible format strings, see https://strftime.org/

use_timestamp::
	Specifies keys for which the timestamp should be returned as output instead of the text or numeric value.
