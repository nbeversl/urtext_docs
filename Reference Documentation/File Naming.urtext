File Naming _

Since node identities are independent of their filenames, you can use any naming convention you want. Urtext can also rename files automatically in convenient formats based on their title and/or other metadata. Renaming by number is useful, for instance, if you want file-level nodes easily readable inside a file system, mobile app, or other file browser.

To rename a file, select "Rename File from Meta" from the command palette (Command-P). By default, this will rename the files alphabetically by title, with numerical prefixes to preserve ordering where the filesystem might not.

This behavior can be changed, if desired, by modifying the `filenames` key of project settings
