Projects _

An Urtext project is a single folder. The folder must contain at least one file with an Urtext Node ID. 

To make an new empty project, select "Urtext : New Project" from the Sublime Command Palette. Sublime will ask for a folder location and a new project will be created in the specified location.

{ Using/Adding Existing Files _

	Once a folder contains at least one file with a node ID, you can add and use existing plaintext files in the project without any modification. However for most of the benefits of Urtext you must minimally an ID (| Node IDs >01q) in each file.
	
	To do so, select `Urtext : Import Project` from the Sublime Command palette.

    Note the append will occur without a confirmation dialog, so if you are just experimenting with this system, consider making a copy of your file folder so you can revert without having to manually remove the metadata.
