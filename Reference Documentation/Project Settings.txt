Project Settings _

{ 
	This is the `project_settings` node for the "Urtext Documentation" Urtext project. In the metadata for this node you can specify settings for the project.

	The `project_settings` node is optional. To create one, make a node and use metadata to give it the title `project_settings`, as this node has. (The othertext content of the node does not matter.)

	
	always_oneline_meta::False
	When creating a new node, sets whether the metadata will appear on one line separated by semicolon,
	or on separate lines.

	console_log::True
	(True or False): Sets whether Urtext will log updates, errors, messages to Sublime's Python console.
	(Press Control-tilde(~)  to open the console)

	filenames::PREFIX - index - title - _oldest_timestamp
	Specifies format for filenames when using | Reindex Files >qd2

	file_index_sort::index - _oldest_timestamp
	When using Reindex Files with an index prefix, specifies the order in which the files should be indexed. For more information | Reindex Files >qd2

	hash_key::test
	The keyname to use for the hash mark metadata shortcut. See | Hash Key >4ry

	history_interval::10
	Sets the interval (in seconds) at which history snapshots should be taken of your views. Increase the interval to have smaller .diff files in your /history folder. Decrease it to have more granular edit history.

	home::013
	Identifies the home node for the project, connected to the "Home" key
	For example, Press Ctrl-Shift-H to go to the Home node of this documentation, whose ID is 013

	node_date_keyname::timestamp
	When creating a new node, if the node gets a timestamp key, this sets the keyname.

	numerical_keys::_index - index
	Sets keys that should always be interpreted numerically for sorting and processing in dynamic output.

	project_title::Reference Documentation
	Provides a title for the entire project

	timestamp_format::%a., %b. %d, %Y, %I:%M %p
	Set the format of the timestamp when using | Insert Timestamp: ctrl + shift + t >7b8
	This accepts a Python `strftime` directive. For possible format strings, see https://strftime.org/

	timezone::US/Eastern
	Specifices a timezone to which the timestamp keys should be localized, or, if including a timezone in the `timestamp_format`, what timezone to include.

	title::project_settings
	Reserved key for every node, used here to specificy this node as containing project settings (see above).

	open_with_system::pdf 
	File extensions to always open using the default system application.

	new_file_node_format::$timestamp $id $cursor
	Spcifies the default format for new file nodes. The following values can be string together in any way:
		$timestamp
		$id (required)
		$device_keyname
		$cursor - where to position the cursor

	contents_strip_outer_whitespace::True
	When including contents in dynamic nodes, determines whether leading or trailing whitespace gets stripped from the dynamic output.

	import::False
	If set to true, all new text files added to the project folder get imported automatically on the fly by adding an Urtext Node ID.

	exclude_from_star::title - _newest_timestamp - _oldest_timestamp - _breadcrumb - def
	When marking metadata using the * and ** syntax, these keys will get omitted, if present.

	console_log::True
	Output errors and messages to the Python console (Sublime Text)

	tag_other::
	Accepts two values which will be interpreted as key/value.
	When quick-tagging a node from another (see | Quick Tag from Other: ctrl + shift + 0 >zep), this metadata entry will be the 
	one added.
 	
	filename_datestamp_format::%m-%d-%Y
	Specifies how dates will be formatted in filenames when using 

	node_browser_sort::_oldest_timestamp| Reindex Files >qd2
	Specifies the key order by which nodes will sort in the Node Browser dropdown

	breadcrumb_key::
	When popping nodes, optionally adds a breadcrumb showing which node the popped node was popped from, 
	and the timestamp.

	contents_strip_internal_whitespace::True
	When including contents in dynamic nodes, determines whether internal multiline whitespace gets stripped from the dynamic output.

	use_timestamp::updated - timestamp - inline-timestamp - _oldest_timestamp - _newest_timestamp
	Specifies keys for which the timestamp component should be used instead of the text value.

	filename_title_length::100
	Sets a maximum title length (in characters) when using | Reindex Files >qd2

	exclude_files::
	Sets filenames in the project folder to be excluded from the project, if any.

	case_sensitive::title - notes - comments - project_title - timezone - timestamp_format - filenames - weblink - timestamp
	Specifies which keys' contents should be parsed case-sensitive.
