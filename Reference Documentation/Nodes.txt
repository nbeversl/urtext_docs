Nodes _

Urtext's basic unit is a "node", which is a range or set of ranges of text within a file. A folder of nodes is a "project". A node is region, or set of regions, of a file, up to and including the entire file.  A file is itself a node, and nodes can contain other nodes.

The identity of an Urtext node persists no matter its containing filename. This is accomplished by assigning each node a three-character identifier using alpha-numeric characters, providing over 46,000 possible nodes per project. See | Node IDs >01q for more information.

Urtext generates IDs automatically on creation of new nodes. ID's can be changed without affecting functionality, though links must then be manually updated as well. 

It is possible to use files containing no IDs in an Urtext project, but then most of the features of Urtext are lost.

{ Node Titles _

	By default, the full first non-whitespace line of any node is the node's title. This can be overridden using the `title` metadata key or by following the desired text with the underscore (`_`) character as used in this document. @ue2}
