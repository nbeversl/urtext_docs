Cross-Project Linking _

You may link from one project to another within the text. To so this, use the following syntax:

=>"name or path of the other project"
(This link is only an example and is non-functioning)

To add a specific node, add the "pipe and angle-bracket" notation followed by a node title:
=>"name or path of the other project"|? title >

Following this link will change the project context to the named project and open the specified node, if any.Tue., Dec. 12, 2023, 04:20 AM
