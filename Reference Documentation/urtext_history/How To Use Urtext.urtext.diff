Syntax highlighting makes everything easier by showing depth of node nesting and dimming certain elements of the syntax. Select the Sixteen (for light) or Monokai (for dark) color schemes in Preferences -> Color Scheme ... \n\n\t\tThen change to the Urtext syntax by selecting it in View -> Syntax -> Urtext. To avoid having to do this for every file, select View -> Syntax -> Open All with Current Extension As ... -> Urtext. (This can be undone by repeating the same but selecting Plain Text.)  }\n\n\t{\tHiding Tabs _\n\n\t\tIf you prefer a spare, terminal-like view, hide tabs: View -> Hide Tabs.\n\t\tThis preference can also be set on a per-(Sublime)-project basis. See the Sublime documentation.  }\n\n\t{  Hiding Line Numbers _\n\n\t\t\tFor an extra-clean look, hide line numbers by adding:\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t%%-JSON\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\"settings\" : {\n\t\t\t\t\t \"line_numbers\": false,\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t%%-JSON-END\n\n\t\t\t... to your Sublime project settings file. \n\n\t\t\t(Ignore the JSON syntax pass markers above beginning with `%%`. See | Escaping Sections of Text > ) }\n\n\t{  Full Screen / Distraction Free Mode _\n\n\t\tSince you can navigate entirely from within files, Urtext works great in Sublime's Distraction Free Mode. View -> Enter Distraction Free Mode.  }\n\n\t{ Disable Prompts for File Reload _\n\n\t\t Urtext does a lot of writing to files on the fly, often when they are already open. To avoid seeing a dialog every time, add add the following to your Sublime project settings or User Preferences file:\n\t\t\t\t %%-JSON\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \"settings\" : {\n\t\t\t\t\t\"always_prompt_for_file_reload\": false,\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t%%-JSON-END\t\t\n\t\t \n\t}\n\n\t{  Remove Indent Guides _\n\n\t\tFormatting plaintext using tab indentions can look messy if indent guides are on. To turn them off, add to your Sublime project settings file:\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t%%-JSON\n\t\t\t \"settings\" : { \n\t\t\t\t\"draw_indent _guides\": false,\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t%%-JSON-END\n\t}\n\n\t{  Save on Focus Lost _\n\n\t\tUrtext recompiles your project every time a file changes. To make this more automatic, and to reduce the need to manually press save after every edit, add to your Sublime settings file:\n\n\t\t%%-JSON\n\t\t\t\"settings\" : { \n\t\t\t \"save_on_focus_lost\": true \n\t\t\t}\n\t\t%%-JSON-END\n\t\n\t}\n\n\t{  Using a Sublime Project for an Urtext Project _\n\t\n\t\t( see https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/projects.html )\n\n\t\tYou don't need to define a Sublime Project for the Urtext Project, but if you intend to do more than one thing at a time in Sublime, it's convenient to have one; you can then use Select Project -> Quick Switch Project (Ctrl-Super-P) to switch among them.  \n\n\t}\n}\n\n\n{ Dynamic Definitions - Syntax and Parameters _\n\n\tDynamic definitions are powerful instructions for dynamically building nodes from other nodes. Dynamic definitions display content from other nodes in a target dynamic node. \n\n\tDefinitions can be written anywhere; it is not necessary to store a definition in the same file to which it refers. (Definitions cannot, however, be stored in the node they target, since they would overwrite themselves.)\n\n\tDynamic definitions are wrapped with double left and right square brackets(`[[`,`]]`). There are no restrictions on spacing, indentation, newlines, or other arbitrary text or whitespace. The order of parameters within a definition is unimportant; they are evaluated as a group.\n\n\tThis dynamic definition below is for documentation and does not actually do anything. It rather lists every parameter along with an explanation of its use and purpose. For example uses, see |  ?  >k8p\n\n\n\t[[ \tID() \t\t\tTarget node to dynamically populate with output.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAccepts a node title or link t(`| Node title >`)\n\n\t\tINCLUDE()  \t\tNodes to include. \n\t\tor +()\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAccepts one or more key/value pairs and optional parameters.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tComparisons:\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t`=` means equal to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tINCLUDE(key = value)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIncludes all nodes with the given key containing the given value\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t`?` means \"contains\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tINCLUDE(_contents ? some text or content)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIncludes all nodes containing \"some text or content\" in their text contents.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(See also -search)\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t`*` means \"anything\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tINCLUDE(index = *)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIncludes all nodes containing the key `index`\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUse semicolon or newline to separate entries, as everywhere in Urtext.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAdditional Flags:\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAdditional flags can be included in \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tINCLUDE(*) or +(*)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIncludes all nodes in the project\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t`-blank`\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIncludes all nodes that contain only whitespace as their content\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNote these additional flags substitute for semicolons/newlines as separators between entries.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSystem keys:\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUrtext includes some built-in keys whose values are generated automatically. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThese may also be used in INCLUDE(): \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t`_contents` : Refers to a node's text contents. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCan be used, for instance, for full text search or comparison.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tINCLUDE(_contents ?

Note that no text content wrapped between pass markers will appear in Urtext dynamic output, since characters in other syntaxes would have unpredictable interactions.\n\n\n\t{  Generic \n\t\t\n\t\t`Similar to its use in in Markdown, the backtick designates code, plaintext, or preformatted text that should be escaped/ignored.` }\n\n\tFor larger regions of text, or to embed other syntaxes, us the following:\n\n\n\t{ HTML\n\n\t\t%%-HTML\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"example\">\n\t\t\t\tExample HTML\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t%%-HTML-END\n\t   }\n\n\n\t{ JSON\n\n\t\t%%-JSON\n\n\t\t\t{ \t\"title\" : \"example JSON \",\n\t\t\t\t\"example\" : [], \n\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t%%-JSON-END\n\t}\n\n\t{ Python\n\n\t\t%%-PYTHON\n\t\t\n\t\t# Example\n\t\tdef times_ten(i):\n\t\t\treturn i*10\n\n\t\t%%-PYTHON-END   \n\t}\n\n\n\t{ Plaintext\n\n\t\t%%-PLAINTEXT\n\n\t\t\tThis text will get no syntax highlighting.\n\n\t\t%%-PLAINTEXT-END \n\t\t}\n\n\n\n\t{ Documentation\n\n\t\t%%-DOC\n\n\t\tThe \"DOC\" pass marker is used in parts of this documentation in order to Urtext syntax highlighting without parse or execute anything, for documentation and example purposes.\n\n\t\t%%-DOC-END\n\n\t\t} }\n\n\n{ File Naming _\n\n\tSince node identities are independent of their filenames, you can use any naming convention you want. Urtext can also rename files automatically in convenient formats based on their title and/or other metadata. Renaming by number is useful, for instance, if you want file-level nodes easily readable inside a file system, mobile app, or other file browser.\n\n\tTo rename a file, select \"Rename File from Meta\" from the command palette (Command-P). By default, this will rename the files alphabetically by title, with numerical prefixes to preserve ordering where the filesystem might not.\n\n\tThis behavior can be changed, if desired, by modifying the `filenames` key of project settings\n\tSee | project_settings >\n\n\tTo rename multiple files at once, see | Reindex Files > below:\n\n}\n\n{ Reindex Files _\n\n\t\"Reindex Files\" renames all filnames in your project according to the `filenames` key in | project_settings >\n\n}\n\n\n\n{ History _\n\n\tTo access a file's history, use ctrl-shift-G and select a snapshot from the dropdown menu.\n\n\tUrtext has a light built-in versioning system that tracks edits at intervals. It is not necessary to take any explicit actions in order to utilize this. Urtext creates a series of nondestructive snapshots, with each snapshot being a \"diff\", or record of changes, since the previous snapshot. When a previous state is restored, no \"checkout\" or \"rewind\" occurs; rather, the newly restored state is appended to the history. Therefore, in addition to functioning as version control, the feature can also be used as an infinite and non-destructive \"undo/redo\" editing history that saves state when the file is closed. The default interval is 10 seconds, and can be modified in project_settings. \n\n\tHistories are stored in the /history folder inside the project, as .diff files. This folder requires no user involvement. If using another version control tool such as Git, you may wish to add the /history folder to your .gitignore file, so that only explicitly committed versions of your project are visible in distributed repositories.\n\n\t<Fri., Oct. 15, 2021, 01:41 PM>\n\n\t}\n\n{ Using Multiple Projects _\n\n\n\tTo use multiple projects at once, there is a project context manager. When you initially pass a path to Urtext, it looks recursively in all sub folders for additional projects. If it finds a compilable Urtext project in any one, it adds these to the context manager.  You can then freely switch among projects, either explicitly, or using links between the projects (described below). When switching projects, all Urtext's features, content and behavior, including links, compiling, and all functions linked to UI buttons, will operate in the context of the selected project. \n\n\tYou can put all your Urtext projects into sub folders of a single path. Alternatively, you may put them anyplace in the file system and choose as your Urtext root a folder that encompasses them all. Compiling may take longer if Urtext has to search through many unused directories. \n\n\tUsing the standalone Urtext module, it is possible to only instantiate a single project, without the context manager. The current implementations in Sublime and Pythonista, however, use the context manager by default, even if you are only using a single project.\n\n\tRecall that what defines a project is a folder. This is also what separates it from other projects. If you add other Urtext project folders into the initial path, they will all be accessible from the same project list.\n\n\tTo switch among projects in Sublime, select \"Urtext: Select Project\" from the command palette or press Ctrl-Shift-O.\n\n\t{ Project Naming (Identification) _\n\n\tUnlike nodes, projects are uniquely identified by name. For this reason, each project must have an unique name within the running instance of Urtext. Projects can be named using the `project_title` key in the `project_settings` node. If no name is present, the project's name becomes its absolute path in the file system. \n\n\t}\n\n\t{ Cross-Project Linking _\n\n\t\tYou may link from one project to another within the text. To so this, use the following syntax:\n\t\t\n\t\t=>\"name or path of the other project\"\n\t    (This link is only an example and is non-functioning)\n\n\t    To add a specific node, add the \"pipe and angle-bracket\" notation followed by a node title:\n\t\t=>\"name or path of the other project\"| title >\n\n\t\tFollowing this link will change the project context to the named project and open the specified node, if any.\n\n\t\t}\n\n\t}\n", "1676550010": "@@ -6321,16 +6321,28 @@\n s file:%0A\n+%09%09%09%09 %25%25JSON%0A\n %09%09%09%09 %0A%09%09\n@@ -6420,17 +6420,16 @@\n %09%09%09%0A%09%09%09%09\n-%25\n %25-JSON-E\n", "1676551173": "@@ -19135,54 +19135,9 @@\n %0A%09%7D%0A\n-                                           %7D  \n+%7D\n     \n", "1676549983": "@@ -5650,25 +5650,24 @@\n %0A%09%09%09%09%0A%09%09%09%09%25%25\n--\n JSON%0A%09%09%09%09%0A%09%09\n@@ -5730,25 +5730,16 @@\n %09%0A%09%09%09%09%25%25\n--JSON-END\n %0A%0A%09%09%09...\n", "1676549996": "@@ -6325,21 +6325,8 @@\n le:%0A\n-%09%09%09%09 %25%25-JSON%0A\n %09%09%09%09\n", "1676550022": "@@ -6421,25 +6421,17 @@\n %09%09%0A%09%09%09%09%25\n--JSON-END\n+%25\n %09%09%0A%09%09 %0A%09\n@@ -6611,25 +6611,24 @@\n e:%0A%09%09%09%0A%09%09%09%25%25\n--\n JSON%0A%09%09%09 %22se\n@@ -6680,33 +6680,24 @@\n ,%0A%09%09%09%7D%0A%09%09%09%25%25\n--JSON-END\n %0A%09%7D%0A%0A%09%7B  Sav\n@@ -6974,25 +6974,16 @@\n %09%09%7D%0A%09%09%25%25\n--JSON-END\n %0A%09%0A%09%7D%0A%0A%09\n"}
