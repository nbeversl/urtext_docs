History

Though use of powerful version control tools (such as Git, Mercurial, etc.) is possible, Urtext has a lighter built-in versioning system that tracks edits at intervals. It is not necessary to make explicit "commits" in order to utilize this. Urtext creates a single, linear history of each file's content, with each snapshot being a "diff", or record of changes, since the previous snapshot. When a previous state is restored, no "checkout" or "rewind" occurs; rather, the newly restored state is appended to the history. Therefore, in addition to functioning as version control, the feature can also be used as an infinite and non-destructive "undo/redo" editing history that saves state when the file is closed. The default interval is 10 seconds, and can be modified in project_settings. 

To access a file's history, use | Toggle History Traverse: >ndc.

Histories are stored in the /history folder inside the project, as .pkl ("pickle") files. This folder requires no user involvement. If using another version control tool such as Git, you may wish to add the /history folder to your .gitignore file, so that only explicitly committed versions of your project are visible in distributed repositories.
