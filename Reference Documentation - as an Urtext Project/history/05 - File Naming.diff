Urtext can also rename files automatically in convenient formats based on their title and/or index. Renaming by index is useful, for instance, if you want file-level nodes easily readable inside a file system, mobile app, or other file browser.\n\nTo rename a file, select \"Rename File from Meta\" from the command palette (Command-P). This will rename the file in one of the following schema:\n\nIf an index is present:\n\n    <index> <title>.txt\n\nIf no index is present:\n\n    <node id> <title>.txt\n\nThis system preserves automatic numerical sorting within the filesystem, such that the most recent un-indexed nodes appear first. If you want to use another system, such as putting the title first, you can do so.\n\n\n@01m\nUpdated::<Sat., Sep. 19, 2020, 01:21 PM>\n"}
