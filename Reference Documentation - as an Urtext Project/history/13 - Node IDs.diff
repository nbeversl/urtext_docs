They are assigned in random order so the probability of accidentally creating two nodes with the same ID is minimal when using the project across many devices that may not always be in sync.\n\nWhen an ID is deleted from a project, new nodes are later assigned to vacant node IDs.\n\n{ Inserting a Node ID manually\n\n\tControl-Shift-I will insert a new and unused node anywhere in the project, in case you delete one or want to insert one manually.  @04s}\n\nNode IDs can also be user-created arbitrarily if for some reason you want to. If you do this, note that node IDs are case-insensitive.\n\nIf more than one Node ID appears in a node, only the first one is used as the Node's ID; the rest are treated (indexed) as regular metadata.\n\n{ \tDuplicate Node IDs\n\n\tIf two nodes end up with the same ID, only one (the first one found) will be assigned the ID. The entire second file containing the node with the duplicate ID will contain a warning message. See | Errors and Warnings >bpk\n\n\tTo correct the problem, it is necessary to manually change the duplicate ID to a new one.
