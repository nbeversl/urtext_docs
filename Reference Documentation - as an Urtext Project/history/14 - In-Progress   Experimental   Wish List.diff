While it does not provide the elegant UI of Sublime Text, it can be set up to meet the project criteria described in >008, including the requirement that the content wholly reside on every device and not depend on an internet connection.\n\n\tPythonista can import and manipulate files directly in iCloud Drive. However, iCloud Drive does not always sync folder changes in the background, and/or syncs the file list without syncing full file contents. This makes it necessary to open the iOS Files app in order manually trigger a sync before using the Urtext project. In the event one or more files is missing or different among devices, these differences will propogate to dynamic nodes with wrong, stale, or missing information. When this occurs many times, file version conflicts develop.\n\n\tA cleaner solution using Dropbox is possible using the Synchronator module (https://github.com/markhamilton1/Synchronator). This module provides a route to automate explicit bidirectional syncing directly between Dropbox and Pythonista environment on demand, such as whenever the project is being used. The module is complicated to install.\n\n\t{  Synchronator Setup \n\n\t\tDOCUMENTATION COMING\n\n\t\t\n@01z }\n\n\tSyncing manually comes with the drawback that changes made on the iOS device will not themselves sync to Dropbox in the background. For instance, if changes are made to a file on iOS while not connected to the internet and Pythonista, the project will have to be explictly synced at a later time. So there remains the possibility that projects will get out of sync.\n\n\n@01y }\n\n\nImport/Export to/from: Markdown, HTML, pure plain text, JSON\n\n\n\n\n\n@014\nupdated::<Wed., Jul. 03, 2019, 04:09 PM>\ntags::"}
