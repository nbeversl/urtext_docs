{"1632754187": "Description _\n        \n        Urtext is a syntax and interpreter for writing, connecting and organizing text.\n\n        Urtext's basic unit is a \"node\", which is a range or set of ranges of text within a file. A folder of nodes is a \"project\". The Urtext interpreter is aware of all the nodes in a project at once, so nodes can reference, modify, and organize one another, across hundreds or thousands of files. The | Basic Syntax >znj permits instructions embedded into the text itself. \n     \n        The present interpreter for Urtext is in Python and can be used wherever Python 3.3 or later runs. Equivalent or variant interpreters could be created in any language or editing environment. \n\n        Urtext has no built-in user interface; it only compiles and manages the files. Using Urtext requires an implementation within a text editor or text view, with a wrapper to pass messages between back and forth. Currently there is a package for Sublime Text (Mac/Windows/Linux) and a script for Pythonista (iOS).   @yv2"}
