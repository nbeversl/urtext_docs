It explains installation and setup, the basic Urtext syntax, and thed Sublime Text commands and key bindings.  This repository also contains a fuller reference guide and a \"walkthrough\" project, both fully functioning Urtext projects with which to experiment with Urtext's features. \n\n  The documentation is in active development. It may be incomplete or behind features/functionality of Urtext. Edits and revisions are encouraged in the form of issues and pull requests (https://github.com/nbeversl/urtext-docs/pulls, https://github.com/nbeversl/urtext-docs/issues).\n\n@pjk"}
