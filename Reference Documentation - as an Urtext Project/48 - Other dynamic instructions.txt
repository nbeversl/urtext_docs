Other dynamic instructions

Some dynamic instructions do things other than populate or modify contents of nodes.	

{  	tag_all

		tag_all:(key):(value):recursive?

		The `tag_all` instruction tags all children of the target node with the key/value pair specified. If `:recursive` is appended, it will tag all descendents, not just the children. This will affect not just existing children/descendants, but all subsequently added ones as well. When the dynamic definition is removed, the tags are removed from the children/descendants. 

		Note that metadata tags do not actually get added to the inline text of the the children/descendants as a result of this instruction, only that they acquire the specified key/value metadata pair for all purposes metadata serves within Urtext.
