Extending Node Lists Into Trees using DEPTH

By default, Node lists are "one-dimensional". With the DEPTH parameter, you can expand these to hierarchical nested nodes up to arbitrary depth, whether from | Inline Nodes >004 or from | Pointers >lmu.

[[  
	These parameters are mostly the same as for the previous examples ( see | Lists >twz) 
	Here they are strung together on a single line; recall that formatting does not matter.
	ID(>nc6) +(*) FORMAT(indent:2) HEADER(Example List 3)

	Here we have omitted the LIMIT parameter, so the definition returns all nodes in this documentation.

	The DEPTH paramter specifies how many levels deep we want to view nested hierachies. We've set it to 5 to avoid an enormous output, but try changing the number (or other parameters in the definition) to see the difference in output. 
	DEPTH(5)
