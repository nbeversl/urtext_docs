Installation and Setup (Sublime Text / Desktop) _

For desktop use (PC/Mac/Linux) Urtext is implemented in Sublime Text.

1. Download Sublime Text. (https://www.sublimetext.com/).

2. Download Urtext and all its dependencies from the monorepo at `https://github.com/nbeversl/urtext_deps`. You can either download this repository as a .ZIP file and unzip it, or if you want to maintain version control, use `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/nbeversl/urtext_deps`. Put the contents of the cloned/unzipped folder (important: not the folder itself) directly into your `Sublime Text 3/Lib/python3.3` folder.

3. Download the Sublime Urtext package at `https://github.com/nbeversl/urtext_sublime`. Place it in your Packages folder (Sublime Text 3/Packages)

4. Clone/download this documentation repository and open its folder in Sublime. It will automatically be read as an Urtext project.

Once the Sublime package is installed, it will always look for any files with the .txt extension in open folders and attempt to compile them into a project. To open an existing Urtext project, open the folder, a file in the folder, or a Sublime project that includes the folder, and any feature described in this documentation will work.

To make a new project, open an empty folder and select Select `Urtext : Initialize Project` from the Sublime Command Palette. For more information, see | Projects >dce.
