	Dynamic definitions can contain arbitrary text. The only parts read by the compiler are the function names with their parameters in parentheses. Like nodes, you can format/indent/comment these definitions any way you want.

	This definition targets ID m1r, which appears immediately below: | ; >m1r.
	ID(>m1r) 

	The asterisk means to include all nodes in the project. 
	INCLUDE(*)

	The LIMIT parameter limits the output to the specified number of results. 
	Note that the default sort order is alphabetical. 
	LIMIT(20)

	FORMAT(indent:3)
	Here the FORMAT parameter is used to indent the output 3 tabs.
	HEADER(Example: Nodes from the Documentation\n flags::exclude_from_export)
