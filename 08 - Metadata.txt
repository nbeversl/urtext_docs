Metadata _

{ General Syntax _

  Every node can have an unlimited number of metadata entries. Metadata is structured in double-colon-separated key/value pairs, with the value (to the right of the colon) containing an optional timestamp. Examples:

        purpose::This node describes Metadata in Urtext <Thu., Jun. 11, 2020, 09:09 PM>
        audience::Urtext user 

  Nodes can be searched and sorted by their metadata using | Dynamic Definitions >07u. Metadata entries also "remember" their location, allowing them to serve double duty contextual markers or "bookmarks". 

  Other than a few reserved key/value pairs, metadata is user-defined. Keys must be single words, though characters such as dash and underscore are allowed. Values may include spaces. Terminate metadata entries using either a new line or a semicolon. Using the semicolon option, several entries may be strung together on a single line:

      one_key::some value; another_key::some_other_value <Thu., Sep. 10, 2020, 05:37 PM>;
      
  Note that a timestamp anywhere in the value will be indexed as the timestamp for the whole metadata entry. If more than on timestamp appears in an entry, only the first one is indexed. @8dw}
  
{ Timestamps _                                                                 

  {   Syntax and Format _

      Text between two angled brackets (`< >`) is parsed as a timestamp whenever the first character inside the brackets is not `!`, `-` or whitespace. Urtext utilizes the Python `dateutil` module to loosely parse dates in almost any format. For instance, all of the following are valid:

            <Fri., Oct. 09, 2020, 09:59 AM>
            <February 23, 1848>
            <May 1946>
            <1066>
            ... and so on

      Press | Insert Timestamp: `ctrl + shift + t` >7b8 to insert the current date and time anywhere. The format of the resulting timestamp can be changed in project_settings using the | `timestamp_format` >00n key.

      Timestamps may also be used anywhere without a keyname; "inline" timestamps that are not part of a keyed metadata entry are auto-assigned the keyname `inline-timestamp`. Like all metadata, they remember their position and may function doubly as anchors/bookmarks. @005}

  {   Tracking Node Dates and Times _

      Reliance on the operating system's "created" or "modified" file date metadata is avoided, since these can be inadvertently overwritten during ordinary file system operations. Instead, new file-level nodes receive a "timestamp" metadata key by default when created: updated::<Thu., Sep. 10, 2020, 05:42 PM>. The default keyname can be changed using the | `node_date_keyname` >8p4 key in project_settings. @cee}
    
  {   Time Zones _

      Time zones are not required. If no time zone is present, Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) is added by default for parsing/comparison purposes. To modify this default, set the  | `timezone` >boe key in project_settings to another valid value. @7w6}

{  Case-sensitivity _

    For comparison/filtering/sorting purposes, values are not case-sensitive. @l36}

 { Reserved Keys _

      There are two reserved keys that Urtext interprets in a special way:

      {   `index`
    
         Provides a way to give nodes a sort order in | The Node Browser >01i.  Indexed nodes will sort before (above) the others, lowest numbers appearing first. To utilize, add a two-digit sort index (00-99) to a node, such as:  index::03    
         You can give the same index number to multiple nodes; in this case they sort first by index, then by timestamp, newest first.

         Unindexed nodes will display underneath indexed nodes, by timestamp, newest first. @00z}

      { `title`
        
        Overrides the node title, which is by default the full first non-whitespace line. @pz3}

      {  `def`

        Generated automatically in a dynamic node, contains a link to the node containing the definition. @5cq}
