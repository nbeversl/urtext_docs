Split Nodes

A node region can be split into two separate nodes by placing the `%` character as the first character on a line. Each node must then have its own ID, which you can either generate manually (see Inserting a Node ID manually >04s) or with the split node shortkey (below, >0mn).

	{{ First Example Split Node /-- ID: jym --/

	This node must contain its own ID (above).

% 

	Second Example split Node

	This node also contains its own ID (below)

	 /-- id: ftz --/ }}

Note using a `%` symbol at the file level (outside of an inline node wrapper) is equivalent to dividing the file into multiple file-level nodes; inline nodes generated inside any of these will be children only of their containing node, not of any other file-level nodes in the same file.

{{ Shortkeys to Create Split Nodes

	These also insert an ID directly above the split marker.
